## Abstract
This study investigates how Muslim spouses perceive and negotiate their rights and duties within marital relationships using a corpus of fatwa inquiries. By analyzing questions posed by the mustaftīs (inquirers), we examine the interplay of traditional norms and contemporary religious discourse. Using ConceptNet, we created a lexicon delineating spousal rights and employed it to uncover prominent themes in the dataset. 

The findings underscore the importance of Shariʿah as a foundational framework while emphasizing the need for context-specific interpretations often sought through fatwa consultations. This work also demonstrates the potential of corpus linguistics in understanding the application of religious texts to modern marital issues. Further research is encouraged to explore fatwas across languages and cultures.
